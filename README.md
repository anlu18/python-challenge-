## PyBank Challenge

### Overview
This challenge involves creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company using data from `budget_data.csv`. The dataset contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The script calculates the following key financial metrics:

- **Total Number of Months:** The total count of months included in the dataset.
- **Net Total Profit/Losses:** The sum of all "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- **Average Change in Profit/Losses:** The changes in "Profit/Losses" from month to month, and the average of these changes.
- **Greatest Increase in Profits:** The date and amount of the largest increase in profits over the period.
- **Greatest Decrease in Profits:** The date and amount of the largest decrease in profits over the period.

### Example Output
The financial analysis should output results similar to the following:

```
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22,564,198
Average Change: $-8,311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1,862,002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1,825,558)
```

The final script also prints this analysis to the terminal and exports the results to a text file.

## PyPoll Challenge

### Overview
This challenge involves helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The task is to create a Python script that analyzes poll data from `election_data.csv`. The dataset consists of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The script calculates the following election metrics:

- **Total Number of Votes Cast:** The total count of votes in the dataset.
- **Candidates List:** A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- **Percentage of Votes per Candidate:** The percentage of the total votes each candidate won.
- **Total Votes per Candidate:** The total number of votes each candidate received.
- **Election Winner:** The candidate who received the most votes.

### Example Output
The polling analysis should output results similar to the following:

```
Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 3521001
-------------------------
Candidate 1: 63.0% (2218231)
Candidate 2: 36.0% (1230546)
Candidate 3: 1.0% (34724)
-------------------------
Winner: Candidate 1
-------------------------
```

The final script also prints this analysis to the terminal and exports the results to a text file.
